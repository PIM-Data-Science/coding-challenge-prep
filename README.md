# Prescient Coding Challenge Preparatory Material 2023

The content of the preparatory material is to introduce you to time series data and basic methods of working/viewing time series data.

## Instructions

Follow the content in either `prep.py` or `prep.ipynb` files. The recommendation is to clone the repo working in VS Code or start a GitHub Workspace to work through the content.

The Python files are executed assuming a relative path or your current working directory is the repo folder.

**The Plotly charts in the Jupyter file preview does not render. You must run the scripts yourself to see the charts.**
